## Positions open

We have positions open for junior research fellows, I-Ph.D. / Ph.D. students and Postdoctoral research associates to work on the following topics.
- computational organic chemistry (retrosynthesis, and reaction mechanism elucidation)     
- computational chemistry (bechmarking and calibration of electronic structure methods)      
- computational materials science (crystal structure prediction, electronic and mechanical properties of solids) 
- cheminformatics (development of models for molecular structure-property correlation)     
- machine learning model development (for molecular and materials datasets)    
- phenomenological models of condensed matter    

We are also interested in several other topics. Here are the pre-requisites to apply for these positions. 

1. Junior research fellow (JRF): M.Sc. in Chemistry/Physics or B.Tech in a suitable discipline. A valid CSIR/GATE score.  
2. Integrated-Ph.D. / Ph.D. students: Chemistry/Physics students enrolled in TIFRH graduate school.   
3. Postdoctoral research associates (PDRA): Ph.D. in Chemistry/Physics or a suitable discipline.
