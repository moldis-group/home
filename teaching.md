#### _What are some good text books to consult for QM-1?:_ 

For the 2022 course, please follow Sakurai's book along with the additional notes provided above. In the next years, we may offer the QM-1 course based on combination of the following texts. Feel free to check them out. 

1. _Modern Quantum Mechanics_, J. J. Sakurai, J. J. Napolitano, Cambridge University Press (Edition-3, 2021).   
2. _Principle of Quantum Mechanics_, R. Shankar, Springer (Edition-2, Sixth Indian Reprint 2015).

4. _Quantum Physics_, Michel Le Bellac, Cambridge University Press (Edition-1, 2006).   
5. _Quantum Mechanics: Fundamentals_, Kurt Gottfried Tung-Mow Yan, Springer (Edition-2, 2003).  
6. _Lectures on Quantum Mechanics_, Steven Weinberg, Cambridge University Press (Edition-2, 2015).   
 
There are several books that discuss certain topics remarkably well. Here is a short list.

1. _Introductory Quantum Mechanics_, Richard L. Liboff, Pearson (Edition-4, 2002).   
2. _A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics_, John S. Townsend, Viva (First Indian Edition, 2010, Reprinted 2017).   
3. _Quantum Mechanics_, David McIntyre, Corine A. Manogue, Janet Tate, Pearson (First Indian Edition, 2016).      
4. _Quantum Mechanics: Theory and Experiment_, Mark Beck, Oxford University Press (Edition-1, 2012).   

Further, there is a long list of classic texts that I will list some other time.

#### _Optional reading on measurement, entanglement and related topics:_    

We will not discuss these topics in this course but for those interested in getting some idea of these topics, here is a list of references.

1. _Quantum Physics: A First Encounter_, Valerio Scarani, Oxford University Press (Edition-1, 2006).    
2. _A Short Introduction to Quantum Information and Quantum Computation_, Michel Le Bellac, Cambridge University Press (Edition-1, 2006).  

#### _Optional reading of interesting articles and reviews:_    

This list is maintained (and will be regularly updated) just for the sake of collecting interesting articles that can be read during the QM-1 course. Feel free to go through them.
