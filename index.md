## Laboratory for Chemical Space Design
We are a small team of chemists, physicists, and an engineer. Topics of interest to us, in no particular order of preference, are Chemical compound space design, Quantum mechanics, Machine learning and Big Data analytics, Computational materials science, High-performance computing, Femtosecond electron dynamics, Anharmonic vibrational spectra, Potential energy surfaces, and Computer-based science education. Our present research activities are driven by the requirements of our MolDis initiative.
