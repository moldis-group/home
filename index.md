## Laboratory for Chemical Space Design
We are a small interdisciplinary team at the [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Hyderabad, India](https://www.tifrh.res.in/). Topics of interest to us, in no particular order of preference, are Chemical compound space design, Quantum mechanics, Machine learning and Big Data analytics, Computational materials science, High-performance computing, Density functional theory, Femtosecond electron dynamics, Anharmonic vibrational spectra, Potential energy surfaces, and Computer-based science education. Our present research activities are largely driven by the requirements of our MolDis initiative.

### Project MolDis
MolDis, our big data analytics platform for MOLecular DIScovery is now open for public access. Please click the logo below for more details.

In addition, we have also developed a lot of _inhouse_ codes!

We have access to _all_ books ever published related to our activities.
