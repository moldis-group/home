## Laboratory for Chemical Space Design
We are a small interdisciplinary team at the [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Hyderabad, India](https://www.tifrh.res.in/). Topics of interest to us, in no particular order of preference, are Chemical compound space design, Quantum mechanics, Machine learning and Big Data analytics, Computational materials science, High-performance computing, Density functional theory, Femtosecond electron dynamics, Anharmonic vibrational spectra, Potential energy surfaces, and Computer-based science education. Our present research activities are largely driven by the requirements of our MolDis initiative.

### Project MolDis
MolDis, our big data analytics platform for MOLecular DIScovery is now open for public access. Please click the logo below for more details.
